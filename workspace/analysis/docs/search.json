proportions by inference (a, d, i) and type (must, prob, have to, will, bare). Confidence intervals are Morey–Cousineau, truncated to [0,1].\nPer-cell trials and items increase across blocks:\n\nprob: n = 10, N = 5\n\nwill: n = 10, N = 5\n\nhave to: n = 14, N = 7\n\nbare: n = 22, N = 11\n\nBlock: prob (n = 10; N = 5)\n\na: prob 0.70 (0.42–0.98) &gt; must 0.30 (0.02–0.58)\nd: must 0.70 (0.42–0.98) &gt; prob 0.30 (0.02–0.58)\ni: prob 0.60 (0.17–1.00), must 0.40 (0.00–0.83)\n\nTakeaway: Strong complementarity—prob peaks in a, must in d; i is mixed with wider CIs.\nBlock: will (n = 10; N = 5)\n\na: must 1.00 (1.00–1.00); all others 0.\n\nd: must 0.80 (0.34–1.00); will 0.20 (0.00–0.66)\ni: must 0.80 (0.52–1.00); will 0.20 (0.00–0.48)\n\nTakeaway: Will is at (or near) floor; must dominates, with a small will share in d/i.\nBlock: have to (n = 14; N = 7)\n\na: must 0.93 (0.78–1.00); have to 0.07 (0.00–0.22)\nd: must 0.93 (0.78–1.00); have to 0.07 (0.00–0.22)\ni: must 0.71 (0.50–0.93); have to 0.29 (0.07–0.50)\n\nTakeaway: Must is clearly preferred; i shows a modest but reliable share for have to.\nBlock: bare (n = 22; N = 11)\n\na: must 0.86 (0.73–1.00); bare 0.14 (0.00–0.27)\nd: must 0.91 (0.73–1.00); bare 0.09 (0.00–0.27)\ni: must 0.86 (0.73–1.00); bare 0.14 (0.00–0.27)\n\nTakeaway: Must overwhelmingly beats bare across all inference conditions; bare shows a small baseline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Reading Times Summary"
